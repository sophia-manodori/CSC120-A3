Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? 
I did not.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? 
I attended the friday morning office hours with Jordan.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I kind of like it, but it's definitely a difficult transition from Python. It's very picky and so you have to be super careful about what you put down. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?  I think java in general has more steps to program something, like to do something simple I feel like you have to do way more steps and take way more precautions in java. I also don't really understand the class-method-object stuff, but I think that's just trial and error. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would recommend taking an online intro to java course online for like a week or two just so when you get a big assignment like this, you don't have to google as much, because I had to do a lot of documentation research which, I've discovered, is really difficult with java and very confusing.
